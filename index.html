								<h1>What is Node.js?</h1>
									<p>Node.js is a server side scripting language from Javascript for use of application building.
									It is event driven and uses non-blocking in order to have the greatest optimization ability. It operates 
									using Google’s V8, operates on a single thread, and uses event loops and package management. </p>
							<h1>What makes node different?</h1>
									<p>Node.js is different in that it uses push technology, which long story short, means that both the client and 
									the server are able to communicate in real-time. The use of non-blocking and the fact that it is event driven makes 
									it able to handle many connections which brings on it’s scalable nature. The single threading also makes it difference
									than traditional operation.</p>
							<h1>What is the concept of non blocking IO?</h1>
									<p>Non-blocking I/O in simple terms is input and output that is able to do multiple processes while the original is 
									still working. This is what gives Node.js it’s ability to have such a great amount of concurrent connections while staying 
									fast and scalable. </p>
